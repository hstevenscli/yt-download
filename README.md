# YouTube Downloader

This is my personal YouTube downloader project using the python library PyTube.
This project is in early stages of development,
only being able to be run in the command line.

My hope is to eventually have a GUI application as the face of the project.

## Using a list of urls

Put the YouTube links in 'urls.txt' and run yt_download.py. When prompted choose 'list'.

## Using a single url

Run yt_download.py. When prompted choose 'url'.
